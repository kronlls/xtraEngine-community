Logged into github and finally worked on the main script.

# What it does and how it works:
-----------------------------------
# 1st: What it does:
 
 
 Writes a line to the console saying that it initialized and is running, then the system goes ahead and tests HTTP
by pinging a domain (Tlochsta @ kron's tbs), and outputs 1/2 messages; One says Systems Up! (if up) and One says Systems down!.
